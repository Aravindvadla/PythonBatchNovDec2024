    Recap Class 3


## Class 5 

 1. Code space has 30 days data retention time, even when the code is commited.
 2. Best practice : Start day with git pull request
 3. Moment "" come it becomes or reads as a string,  only one under score is permitted 
 eg:  #Larger numbers
    speed_of_light = 29999996
    print(type(speed_of_light),speed_of_light)

    speed_of_light = 299,999,96
    print(type(speed_of_light),speed_of_light)

    speed_of_light = 299_999_96
    print(type(speed_of_light),speed_of_light)

    speed_of_light = "299_999_96"
    print(type(speed_of_light),speed_of_light)

    output: int = 29999996
    tuple = (299,999,96)
    int = 29999996
    str = 299_999_96

 4. Run all will fail whenever there are expection 

 5. Design ration store - Arthmetic opertion 
    Steps to write code 
    >Write algorithm or plan of action or write it on paper
    > eg for ration store > steps >  (variables calcucation and then results) for eg: Cost , Name , quantity, compute seeling price, add total of times, subsidy, calcutaions and print results.
    > Comment indicated what happens in next step very important to hav comments 
    > For variable use underscore eg: cost_of_rice and for class cammel cases
    > logical mistake python wont help only syntax error python helps
    >Try using cmd lime more
    > Best practice use print statements write some statement and print it. eg: instead of output 1300 use The total price is 1300 USD
 6. Entire flow is understood in previous steps 
 7. Any program write the constants very imp 
 8. eg : Fruit store 
        Dozen = 12
        Discount = 25
        Tax = 30
 9. If variables not given get it from the user (the person running the code) python used input() = to get th value in runtime

 10. make sure to write .py file always for python file
 11. Input() will print what ever we enter eg : 4 and qunaity of rice is 4 
 12. String repetion opetaion: in other languuages when you multipy  string with integer it will throw error but in python we get repeate values 
 eg: cost_of_rice = 10 * per kg
 input() > Qty of rice : 4 
 SP of rice = 4444444444
 13. to avoid this we have to convert it. updating a vaiable eg: qty_of_rice = input ("Enter Qty if rice (in Kgs): ") = opertion
 qty_of_rice = int(qty_of_rice) = updating
 reason input() will take any input as string variable

 there is nothing wrong to do opertain and updation on same varialble

 14. Type conversion: 
 Data type conversions 
 int float complex boolean string None

 Interger 

 3 sets of conversion 
 decimal int() base 10 0-9
 binary bin() base 2 0-1
 hexadecimal hex() base 16  0-9 and A-F
 octal oct() base 8 0-7

 Float 
 float()

 String 
 str()

15. eg: 
#int to float 
print(12, float(12))
output: 12 12.0

16. eg:  str to float 

23 float 23 = 23 23.0
23.24 float 23.24 = 23.24
2 3 float2 3 = error cannot convert
Float very intelligent to convert try all types

17. Integer
binary reprsesentaion in only for interger not floating values

0b is stating that his is a binary vlaue 

assignments 
Savings bank 
bank loan SI and CI
convert from  hexa to oct vice versa
Feet to Conversion 

18. abs value give positive or negative 

19. complex value > will have real and imaginary vlaue 


20. Library import math will import all math oprations (beacuse python doesnot have sqrt opertaion )

21. Complex number > made to be complex :) 
  complex number =  real number +/- imaginary number
  pythin j is used to represent imajinary number 



  0j is also complex 
  number folloed by j is complex 
  4*j j4 j*5 not possible

  22. complex built in fucntio we can crete own complex numbers

  23. == checks value equvilance 
   eg: 3 + 4j ==4j + 3
   is true real value compare with real value j value compared with j vlaue
